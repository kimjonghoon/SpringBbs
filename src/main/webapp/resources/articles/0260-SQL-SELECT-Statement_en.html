<h1>SQL SELECT Statement</h1>

<p>
SQL also has a standard.
In this section, we will practice SELECT statements with standard SQL.
The SELECT statement should be written in order.
"SELECT column1, column2, .. FROM table_name" is required.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT column, column ...
FROM table name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY statement
UNION/UNION ALL/INTERSECT/MINUS
ORDER BY statement
</pre>

<p>
Access the scott account with SQL * PLUS and execute all SQL statements that follow.
</p>

<h3>Query all the records in the employee table.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT * 
FROM EMP
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,MGR,HIREDATE,SAL,COMM,DEPTNO 
FROM EMP
</pre>

<p>
The above two SQL statements fetch the same records.
After select, * means all the columns in order.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the employee's name and hire date.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT ENAME,HIREDATE
FROM EMP;
</pre>

<h3>Retrive the employee number and employee's name.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,ENAME 
FROM EMP
</pre>

<p>
You can select and query the columns and change the order of the columns. 
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the JOB from the employee table.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DISTINCT JOB
FROM
EMP
</pre>

<p>
DISTINCT is used when duplicate records need to be shown only once in query results.
</p>

<h3>Find the total number of employees.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT COUNT(EMPNO)
FROM
EMP
</pre>

<p>
COUNT returns the number of records retrieved as one of the group functions.
COUNT (column name) returns the number of non-NULL records, and COUNT (*) returns the number of records containing NULL.
</p>

<h2>WHERE conditions</h2>

<h3>Retrieve the employee with department number 10.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT * 
FROM EMP
WHERE DEPTNO = 10;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve employees with salaries of 2500 or more.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL &gt;= 2500;
</pre>

<p>
A where condition has been added.
Now, only records matching the conditions after where are selected.
The above SQL statement can be used in the where condition with =, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt; 
This is an example using comparison operators.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the employee whose name is 'KING'.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE ENAME = 'KING';
</pre>

<p>
SQL statements are case-insensitive.
However, the data in the column is, of course, case sensitive.
It is stored as KING, but is not searched by king.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve employee number and employee's name whose name begins with S.</h3>   

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE ENAME LIKE 'S%';
</pre>

<h3>Query the employee number and name of the employee whose name includes T in the employee name.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE ENAME LIKE '%T%';
</pre>

<p>
LIKE is used in searches with % and _.
</p>

<dd>
Here's how to edit the SQL statement in the command buffer. <br />
This is useful if you enter the SQL statement incorrectly. <br />
<strong>ed</strong><br />
When you run ed in SQL * PLUS, the system's default editor displays the contents of the buffer.
In the case of Windows, Notepad executes and displays the SQL statements stored in the buffer.
After modifying the contents and closing it in Notepad, execute / to execute the SQL statement in the buffer.<br />

<h3>Retrieve the employee number, name, and commission of the employee with a commission of 300, 500, or 1400.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,COMM
FROM EMP
WHERE COMM = 300 OR COMM = 500 OR COMM = 1400;
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,COMM
FROM EMP
WHERE COMM IN (300,500,1400);
</pre>

<p>
Both are SQL statements that show the same result.
The first SQL statement used the logical operator OR and the second used IN.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the employee number, name, and salary of an employee whose salary is between 1200 and 3500.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL BETWEEN 1200 AND 3500;
</pre>

<p>
SAL BETWEEN 1200 AND 3500 is mathematically 1200 &lt; = SAL &lt; = 3500.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the name, employee number, job, department number of the employee whose job title is manager and whose department number is 30.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT ENAME,EMPNO,JOB,DEPTNO
FROM EMP
WHERE DEPTNO = 30 AND JOB = 'MANAGER';
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the number, name, and department number of an employee whose department number is not 30.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,DEPTNO
FROM EMP
WHERE NOT DEPTNO = 30;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the employee number, name, and commission of the employees whose commissions are not 300, 500, or 1400.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,COMM
FROM EMP
WHERE COMM NOT IN (300,500,1400);
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the name and number of the employee whose name does not contain an S.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE ENAME NOT LIKE '%S%';
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the employee number, name, and salary of employees whose salary is less than 1200 or exceeds 3700.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL NOT BETWEEN 1200 AND 3700;
</pre>

<p>
So far we have seen how to use AND, OR, and NOT.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the name and job of the employee whose his/her supervisor is NULL.</h3>

<p>
Let's see how to use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL to see if a column is NULL or not. 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT ENAME,JOB
FROM EMP
WHERE MGR IS NULL;
</pre>

<h2>GROUP BY</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,AVG(SAL)
FROM EMP
</pre>

<p>
The intent of the above SQL statement is to find the salary average by DEPTNO.
At this time, DEPTNO is used as a column for grouping.
When a group function is used together with a column that is the basis of grouping, the column must be specified after GROUP BY.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the average salary by department number.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,AVG(SAL)
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DEPTNO;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the total number of employees and the number of employees receiving commissions by department number.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,COUNT(*),COUNT(COMM)
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DEPTNO;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the maximum salary and minimum salary by department number.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,MAX(SAL),MIN(SAL)
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DEPTNO;
</pre>

<p>
HAVING is used to extract data from the GROUP BY clause.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the salary averages by department number, but only those with a result of 2000 or higher.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,AVG(SAL)
FROM EMP
WHERE AVG(SAL) &gt;= 2000;
GROUP BY DEPTNO;
</pre>

<p>
You can not use a WHERE conditional statement when you are giving a condition using the GROUP BY clause.
Therefore, the above query generates an error.
To give a condition using the GROUP BY clause, use the HAVING clause instead of the WHERE clause.
Note that in the HAVING clause, there are only the group functions and the columns that are the basis of the grouping.
In the above query, DEPTNO can be used in the HAVING statement because the column that is the basis of the grouping is DEPTNO.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,AVG(SAL)
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DEPTNO
HAVING AVG(SAL) &gt;= 2000;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve salary averages by department number only for employees whose salary is 1000 or higher. However, only records with an average of 2000 or more.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DEPTNO,AVG(SAL)
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL &gt;= 1000
GROUP BY DEPTNO
HAVING AVG(SAL) &gt;= 2000;
</pre>

<p>
The WHERE clause is used to retrieve records matching a specific condition from a table.
The HAVING clause is used to retrieve the records matching a specific condition from the query result of the GROUP BY clause.
</p>

<h2>ORDER BY</h2>

<p>
An ORDER BY statement is required when sorting by any column in a SELECT statement.
The usage is as follows.<br />
ORDER BY ColumnName ASC; or ORDER BY ColumnName DESC;<br />
ASC : Means ascending order and can be omitted.<br />
DESC : Means descending order.<br />
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the employee number, name, and salary in descending order of salary. However, if the salaries are the same, sort in ascending order by name.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL
FROM EMP
ORDER BY SAL DESC,ENAME ASC;
</pre>

<h2>Join</h2>

<p>
Joins are used to query data from two or more tables.
The join condition requires N-1 join conditions when joining N tables.
</p>

<h3>Cartesian product</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMP.ENAME,DEPT.DNAME
FROM EMP,DEPT
</pre>

<strong class="screen-header"><b>C:\</b> Command Prompt</strong>
<pre class="screen">
SQL&gt; select ename,dname
  2  from emp,dept;

48 rows selected.

SQL&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The example of joining in the future should be practiced while considering the Cartesian product above.
A total of 48 rows are generated by multiplying 12 records existing in the EMP table and 4 records existing in the DEPT table.
If you are certain that a column is a specific table column, you can omit the table name like ENAME for EMP.ENAME.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the names of employees and departments.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT ENAME,DNAME
FROM EMP,DEPT
WHERE EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;
</pre>

<p>
You can give the table name an alias in the FROM clause.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,D.DNAME
FROM EMP E,DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;
</pre>


<h3>Retrieve employee name, salarie, and salary grade.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,E.SAL,S.GRADE
FROM EMP E,SALGRADE S
WHERE E.SAL &gt;= S.LOSAL AND E.SAL &lt;= S.HISAL;
</pre>

<p>
The above example uses a comparison operator other than = in the join condition.
If you change this SQL statement from BETWEEN to AND statement:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,E.SAL,S.GRADE
FROM EMP E,SALGRADE S
WHERE E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the employee name, department name, and salary grade.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,D.DNAME,S.GRADE
FROM EMP E,DEPT D,SALGRADE S
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
AND E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the employee name and his/her senior employee name.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,M.ENAME
FROM EMP E,EMP M
WHERE E.MGR = M.EMPNO;
</pre>

<p>
The above results are missing the president record. 
There is no employee whose employee number is NULL, 
so the president record does not match the join condition. 
Nevertheless, if you want to see the president records, you should query as follows.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,M.ENAME
FROM EMP E,EMP M
WHERE E.MGR = M.EMPNO(+);
</pre>

<p>
Such a join is called an outer join.
The outer join is used when you want to include the row in the result even if the join condition is not satisfied.
Outer joins can use the (+) operator to include the excluded rows in the result because they are NULL.
If you add the (+) operator to the right of the WHERE condition, a KING record is included in the result.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the employee name, department name. However, if the employee table does not have an employee with a department number of 40, query the OPERATIONS department to include it in the result.</h3>

FROM EMP E,EMP C
WHERE E.EMPNO &lt;&gt; C.EMPNO
AND E.DEPTNO = C.DEPTNO
AND E.ENAME = 'ALLEN'
ORDER BY C.ENAME;
</pre>

<h2>Using Subqueries</h2>

<p>
A subquery is a SELECT statement enclosed in parentheses () in a SELECT statement and is used to pass the result of a query to the main query.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the name of the department to which 'JONES' belongs.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT DNAME 
FROM DEPT
WHERE DEPTNO = (SELECT DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'JONES');
</pre>

<p>
The query that asks for the department number is a subquery.
This subquery is called a single row subquery because it obtains only one result.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve the employee name, department name of the department 10.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,D.DNAME
FROM EMP E,DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
AND D.DEPTNO = 10;
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT E.ENAME,D.DNAME
FROM EMP E,
(
	SELECT DEPTNO,DNAME
	FROM DEPT
	WHERE DEPTNO = 10
) D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve employee numbers, employee names, and salaries of employees who receive more than average salary.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL &gt; (SELECT AVG(SAL)
	      FROM EMP)
ORDER BY SAL DESC;
</pre>

<h3>Retrieve the employee number and employee name of the employee with the highest salary among the employees with the department number 10.</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">

	     FROM EMP 
	     WHERE DEPTNO = 10);
</pre>
