<h1>Object and Class</h1>

<h2 class="floatstop">Object</h2>
Objects are key to understanding OOP.<br />
There are many examples of real world objects, such as: 
your cup, your computer, you.<br />
Real world objects have 3 characteristics.<br />

<h3>1. property</h3>
Each object has properties.<br />
You have properties, e.g., name, mobile, waist circumference.<br />

<h3>2. behavior</h3>
You have behaviors, e.g., run, walk.<br /> 

<h3>3. one</h3>
Every object are only one.<br />
You are only one.<br />

<h3>Software objects</h3>

Software objects are similar to real world objects.<br /><br />

<em>Software objects are a combination of data and functions.</em>

<br /><br />
A property of the real world object is mapped to the data,<br />
A behavior of the real world object is mapped to the function.<br />

<h2>Class</h2>
A class is the Casting mold from which individual objects are created.<br />
To create an object in a Java program, you must first create a class.<br />

<h3>How to make a class</h3>
Let's think that we have to develop a program for student attendance management.<br />
We are able to extract the properties and behaviors of a student, as follows.<br />
<br />
<em>property: name, total number of absence days.<br />
behavior: absent</em><br />
<br />
Now we can create a student class.<br />

<h6 class="src">Student.java</h6>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<strong>class</strong> Student {
	String name;
	int totalAbsenceDays;
	
	void absent() {
		totalAbsenceDays = totalAbsenceDays + 1;
	}
}
</pre>

<dl class="note">
<dt>class Student {..}</dt>
<dd>
The class name comes after the class keyword.<br />
File name is recommended to be the same as the class name.<br />
</dd>
<dt>String name;</dt>
<dd>
An object stores its state in fields.<br />
The state is a wider concept than OOP's property.<br />

<table class="table-in-article">
<tr>
	<th class="table-in-article-th" style="width: 50%;">String</th>
	<th class="table-in-article-th">name</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="table-in-article-td">field data type</td>
	<td class="table-in-article-td">field name	</td>
</tr>
</table>

A String class belongs to Java APIs.<br />
A String class is used to express a series of characters.<br />
</dd>

<dt>int totalAbsenceDays;</dt>
<dd>

<table class="table-in-article">
<tr>
	<th class="table-in-article-th" style="width: 50%;">int</th>
	<th class="table-in-article-th">totalAbsenceDays</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="table-in-article-td">field data type</td>
	<td class="table-in-article-td">field name</td>
</tr>
</table>

A int is a data type for integer.
</dd>

<dt>void absent() {..}</dt>
<dd>
if absent() does not return a value, you should type void before absent().<br />
if absent() return a value, you should type the data type returned befere absent().<br />
In Java, absent() is called a method not a function.<br />
</dd>
</dl>

Let's make Student executable alone.<br />
Open Student.java and add main method, as below:<br />

<h6 class="src">Student.java</h6>
<pre class="prettyprint">
class Student {
	String name;
	int totalAbsenceDays;
	
	void absent() {
		totalAbsenceDays = totalAbsenceDays + 1;
	}
	<strong>
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Student tom = null;
		Student will = null;

		tom = new Student();
		tom.name = "Thomas Edison";

		will = new Student();
		will.name = "William Blake";

		tom.absent();
		will.absent();
		tom.absent();

		System.out.println(tom.totalAbsenceDays);
		System.out.println(will.totalAbsenceDays);
	}</strong>
}
</pre>

<strong class="screen-header"><b>C:\</b> Command Prompt</strong>
<pre class="screen">
C:\Users\kim&gt;javac Student.java

C:\Users\kim&gt;java Studnet
2
1

C:\&gt;
</pre>

Typing "java Student" drive a new JVM start and the main method of Student class start.<br />
Whenever a JVM is started, the classloader is responsible for loading Java classes that make up the program, such as:<br />
Student, String, System, etc.<br />
A classloader already know the location of classes corresponding to Java APIs, e.g., String, System, etc.<br />
Maybe you should notify the classloader the location of the Student class.<br />
If you want to run in a directory where is no Student class, you should notify the location of Student class to the classloader using java -cp option.<br />

<dl class="note">
<dt>public static void main (String[] args) {..}</dt>
<dd> 
The main method is the starting point of a Java pure application.<br />
You should make the main method in the starting class.<br />
</dd>
<dt>Student tom = null;</dt>
<dd>
This statement declare the reference variable to refer to the Student object and initializes variable to null.<br />
A reference variable saves a reference value which is used to access a object.<br />
A reference variable dose not save a object itself.<br /> 
If you make reference variable does not point any object, you assigned variable to null.<br />
Since null is also value, Student tom; and Stundent tom = null; is a completely different.<br />

<table class="table-in-article">
<tr>
	<th class="table-in-article-th" style="width: 50%;">Student tom;</th>
	<th class="table-in-article-th">Student tom = null;</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="table-in-article-td">
	value of the tom has not been determined.<br />
	(It will be expressed as "not initialized.")
	</td>
	<td class="table-in-article-td">
	null is used to initialize the reference variable.<br />
	null is a value that indicates that don't refer to any object.
	</td>
</tr>	
</table>
</dd>
<dt>tom = new Student();</dt>
<dd>
This statement assigns the reference value of a Student object generated to the Student type reference variable (tom).<br />
if new Student(); runs, the Student object is created in the heap memory space and the reference value required to operate the generated object is returned.<br />
</dd>
<dt>tom.name = "Thomas Edison";</dt>
<dd>
This statement set the name of student objects by using the reference variable (tom).<br />
Usage: Reference variable and the following dott and following the fields or methods of the object.
</dd>
<dt>tom.absent();</dt>
<dd>
This statement call the absent() method of the student which variable tom refer to.<br />
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>System.out.println()</h2>

In the basic example of Java, in order to display the results, so that the frequent use of this method.<br />
Below shows all of the uses for this method.<br />

<h6 class="src">StandardOutput.java</h6>
<pre class="prettyprint">
class StandardOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(true);// boolean ouput and line break
        System.out.println('A');// 'A' output and line break
        char[] x = {'A','B','C'};
        System.out.println(x);//char[] value output and line break
        System.out.println(99.9);//double value output line break
        System.out.println();// simply line break
        System.out.println(99.9F);//float value output and line break
        System.out.println(100);//int value output and line break
        System.out.println(40000000L);//long value output and line break
        System.out.println(System.out);//Object's data type@hashcode ouput and line break
        System.out.println("standard output method");//String value output and line break
    }
}
</pre>

<strong class="screen-header"><b>C:\</b> Command Prompt</strong>
<pre class="screen">
C:\&gt;javac StandardOutput.java

C:\&gt;java StandardOutput
true
A
ABC
99.9

100
40000000

</pre>

The only difference between System.out.print() and System.out.println() is that System.out.print() does not change the line after the output.<br />
