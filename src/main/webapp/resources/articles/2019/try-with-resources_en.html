<h1>try with resources</h1>

<p>
The try with resources statement was introduced in Java 7.
The parentheses follow the try keyword, and the resources are created in parentheses.
Resources that can be created in parentheses must implement java.lang.AutoCloseable.
The try with resources statement ensures that the resource is closed.

Download <a href="/examples/movies.txt">movies.txt</a> and copy it to the src directory.

<pre class="prettyprint">package net.java_school.examples;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class TryWithResourcesTest {

	static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {
	    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
	        return br.readLine();
	    }
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		String firstLine = null;
		firstLine = readFirstLineFromFile("./src/movies.txt");
		System.out.println(firstLine);
	}

}

<p>
The example uses the BufferedReader instance to read the first line from the file.
The BufferedReader is a resource that must be closed at the end of the program.
The example declares a BufferedReader in the try with resources statement.
Since Java 7, BufferedReader implements the AutoCloseable interface.
If you declare a resource that implements AutoCloseable in the try with resources statement, the resource will be closed regardless of whether the try statement is executed normally or abnormally terminated.
</p>

<p>
Before Java 7, to ensure the termination of a resource, whether it is performing normally or abnormally, we used a finally block as follows.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">static String readFirstLineFromFileWithFinallyBlock(String path) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
    try {
        return br.readLine();
    } finally {
    	if (br != null) br.close();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
In the finally block, however, the BufferedReader's close() method can raise an IOException.
</p>

<p>
You can declare more than one resource in a try with resources statement.
The try with resources statement can have catch and finally blocks, which catch and finally block work after the declared resource is closed.
</p>
