<h1>Nested Classes</h1>

<p>
The Java programming language allows you to define a class within another class.<br />
Such a class is called a nested class and is illustrated here:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">class OuterClass {

	class NestedClass {
		//...
	}

}
</pre>

<p>
A nested class is a member of its enclosing class.<br />
Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private.<br />
Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class.<br />
As a member of the OuterClass, a nested class can be declared private, public, protected, or package private.<br />
(Recall that outer classes can only be declared public or package private.)
</p>

<p>
Nested classes are divided into two categories: static and non-static.<br />
Nested classes that are declared static are called static nested classes.<br />
Non-static nested classes are called inner classes. 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">class OuterClass {

	static class StaticNestedClass {
		//...
	}

	class InnerClass {
		//...
	}

}
</pre>

<p>
As with class methods and variables, a static nested class is associated with its outer class.<br />
And like static class methods, a static nested class cannot refer directly to instance variables or methods defined in its enclosing class: it can use them only through an object reference.
</p>

<h3>Why Use Nested Classes?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If a class is useful to only one other class, then it is logical to embed it in that class and keep the two together.</li>
	<li>It increases encapsulation:By hiding class B within class A, A's members can be declared private and B can access them.
In addition, B itself can be hidden from the outside world.</li>
	<li>It can lead to more readable and maintainable code: Nesting small classes within top-level classes places the code closer to where it is used.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
The following code snippet in the ArrayList&lt;E&gt; is a good example.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">public Iterator&lt;E&gt; iterator() {
	return new Itr();
}

private class Itr implements Iterator&lt;E&gt; {
	//...
}
</pre>

<h3>Anonymous Classes</h3>

<p>
The life cycle of a method and its local variables is the same.<br />
The life cycle of the inner class is longer than the method.<br />
For the above reasons,<br /> 
Anonymous Classes defined in the methods is restricted to access only the final local variable.
