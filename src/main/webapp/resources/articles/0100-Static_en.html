<h1>static keyword</h1>

<p>
The static keyword is used to create class-level variables and methods.<br />
Static means that the memory space determined when the class is loaded does not change.<br />
Static variables and methods can be used without creating an object like this:<br />
</p>

<ul>
	<li>ClassName.staticVariable</li>
	<li>ClassName.staticMethod()</li>
</ul>

<p>
The main method is a static method.<br />
If you run java Test at the command prompt, The class loader loads Test.class into memory.<br />
The JVM then calls the main method of the Test class loaded into memory.<br />
</p>

<p>
To run a Java program, the class must first be loaded into memory.<br />
When a class is loaded into memory, space is allocated for static variables.<br />
The memory space to which a static variable is allocated does not change until the end of the program.<br />
</p>

<p>
The memory space to which an object is allocated differs from the memory space in which the class is loaded.<br />
The space to which objects are allocated is the heap memory area of the JVM.<br />
Every time new is run, heap memory is allocated for the object's instance variables.<br />
</p>

<p>
You can not use instance variables in static methods.<br />
It does not make sense to refer to the properties of an object that it can not create.<br />
If you add a main method to the student class and implement it like this, you will get a compile error.<br />
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    absentNum++;
}
</pre>

<p>
Conversely, using static variables or static methods in instance methods is not a problem.<br />
Suppose a student is fined if he / she is absent, late or late.<br />
The fine is $ 3 for absences, and $ 1 for late or early retirement.<br />
The fine must be put in a penalty box.<br />
A penalty box is only one and all students share.<br />
And that it is not a property that distinguishes students from students.<br />
How do I implement a penalty box in code?<br />
A approach is to make the fines a static variable that all student objects share.<br />
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
public class Student {
    <strong>static</strong> int penaltyBox;

    public void absent() {
        this.absent++;
        <strong>Student.penaltyBox</strong> += 3;
    }
    //..Omit
}    
</pre>


<p>
The following is an example of a static variable that stores the total number of users.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
package net.java_school.user;

public class User {

    public <strong>static</strong> int totalUser;
    private String id;
    
    public User(String id) {
        this.id = id;
        total++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        User user1 = new User("hong1440");
        User user2 = new User("im1562");
        User user3 = new User("jang1692");
        
        System.out.println("Total Users : " + <strong>User.totalUser</strong>);
    }

}
</pre>

<strong class="screen-header"><b>C:\</b> Command Prompt</strong>
<pre class="screen">
C:\..&gt;java net.java_school.user.User
Total Users : 3</pre>

<h3>Singleton pattern</h3>

<p>
The design pattern used when only one object needs to be created is a singleton pattern.<br />
Suppose there is only one dinner table at home.<br />
It is not an ideal home if you have several dinner tables and eat each one.<br />
The design of a dinner table object using a singleton pattern is as follows.<br />
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
package net.java_school.home;

public class DinnerTable {

    private <strong>static DinnerTable</strong> instance = new DinnerTable();
    
    public static DinnerTable getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
    
    <strong>private</strong> DinnerTable() {}
    
    //..Omit
  
}
</pre>

<p>
A DinnerTable object is created in the heap memory to initialize a static variable, instance of the DinnerTable, and a reference to the generated object is assigned to the instance static variable.<br />
This reference value can only be obtained through the public getInstance () method.<br />
Set the access modifier of the single constructor to private to prevent the constructor from being called from outside.<br />
This implementation will keep the DinnerTable instance as one until the end of the program.<br />
</p>

<h3>Initialization Order</h3>

<p>
Variables are initialized when allocated to memory space.<br />
If there is no initial value, the Boolean type is false, the numeric type is 0, and the reference type is initialized to null.<br />
<br />
Instance member variables are initialized when the object is created.<br />
<br />
The initialization order is static variables, instance variables, and constructors.<br />
<br />
Static variables and static blocks are at the same level.<br />
So the previous one in the code is initialized first.<br />
<br />
For instance blocks, the compiler adds the implementation block of the instance block to the last line of every constructor.<br />
<br />
Predict the results of the next problem.<br />
</p>

<h6 class="src">A.java</h6>
<pre class="prettyprint">
package net.java_school.classvar;

public class A {

    public A() {
        System.out.println("A() has executed.");
    }
        
}
</pre>

<h6 class="src">B.java</h6>
<pre class="prettyprint">
package net.java_school.classvar;

public class B {
    private A a = new A();
    
    {
        System.out.println("B instance block has executed.");
    }
    
    static {
        System.out.println("B static block has executed.");
    }
    
    private static B b = new B();

    private B() {
        System.out.println("B() has executed.");
    }
    
    public B(int a) {
        System.out.println("B(int) has executed.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new B();
        new B(1);
    }
        
}
</pre>

<strong class="screen-header"><b>C:\</b> Command Prompt</strong>
<pre class="screen">
C:\..&gt;java net.java_school.classvar.B
